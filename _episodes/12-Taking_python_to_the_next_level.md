<!-- # Imports best practice 

We will go over this in detail next week, but it should be stated. 

- Use **import x** for importing packages and modules.
- Use **from x import y** where x is the package prefix, and y is the module name with no prefix.
- Use **from x import y as z** if two modules named y are to be imported or if y is an inconveniently long name.
- Use **import y as z** only when z is a standard abbreviation (e.g., np for NumPy). -->
